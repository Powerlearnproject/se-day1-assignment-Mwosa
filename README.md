#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic approach to designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications. It involves applying engineering principles to ensure software is reliable, efficient and scalable.
The importance of software engineering includes:
Ensures software quality – Structured processes reduce bugs and improve performance.
Scalability – Helps build systems that can grow with user demand.
Drives Innovation – Enables advancements in AI, cloud computing, and automation.
Security & reliability – Protects against cyber threats and system failures.
Efficiency & cost-effectiveness – Saves time and resources through best practices.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The birth of software engineering (1968)
Early focus was on structured programming and formal methodologies.
The rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)
Introduction of languages like C++, Java and Python that support reusable, modular code.
Agile revolution (2001-Present)
The Agile Manifesto introduced principles focused on collaboration, flexibility and customer feedback.
This shift led to modern development approaches like Scrum and DevOps, making software development more adaptive and efficient.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning – Define project goals, feasibility, and resource allocation.
Requirements gathering – Collect and analyze what the software needs to do.
Design – Create architecture, user interface and system flow.
Development – Write and implement the actual code.
Testing – Identify and fix bugs before deployment.
Deployment – Release the software to users.
Maintenance – Fix issues, update features and ensure smooth operation.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall methodology follows a linear, step-by-step approach where each phase (planning, design, development, testing and deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is finished, making it ideal for projects with well-defined requirements and strict deadlines.
Example scenario:
Waterfall is best for government projects, healthcare systems or critical infrastructure where requirements must be clear from the start.
On the other hand, Agile is an iterative and flexible approach where development happens in small cycles called sprints. Agile allows continuous changes, testing and feedback, reducing risks and ensuring the software evolves according to user needs.
Example scenario:
Agile is great for startups, web apps and software that needs continuous updates.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer
Writes and maintains code.
Fixes bugs and improves software performance.
Works with designers and testers to ensure functionality.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer
Tests software for bugs and usability issues.
Ensures compliance with requirements.
Automates testing processes for efficiency.
3. Project Manager
Plans and tracks project progress.
Coordinates between teams and stakeholders.
Ensures deadlines and budgets are met.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) help developers write, debug and test code efficiently.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.
Version Control Systems (VCS) track code changes, making collaboration easier.
Examples: Git, GitHub, GitLab.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Debugging complex code - Use debugging tools, logs and divide code into smaller sections.
Tight deadlines - Use Agile methodologies and prioritize features.
Communication issues - Hold regular team meetings and use project management tools.
Keeping ip with technology - Continuously learn through online courses and practice.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing – Tests individual components (e.g. a function in a program).
Integration testing – Ensures different parts work together correctly.
System testing – Tests the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance testing – Confirms that software meets user needs before launch.
Testing prevents errors, improves performance, and ensures a good user experience.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective prompts to get accurate and useful responses from AI models. It’s important because a well-crafted prompt can improve the quality of AI-generated results.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: "Tell me about coding."
Improved prompt: "Can you explain Python's object-oriented programming features with examples?"
Why is the improved prompt better?
It specifies the programming language (Python).
It focuses on a particular topic (object-oriented programming).
It asks for examples, making the response more useful.
